## Four Worlds

| World | Term | Theme | Status |
|-------|------|-------|--------|
| 🪄 The Marauder's Atlas | Term 1: Map Skills | Harry Potter — parchment, ink, magic cartography | ✅ Complete |
| 🐾 The Clan Territories | Term 2: Physical Features of SA | Warriors — territory borders, rivers, escarpment | 🔒 Locked |

## Term 1 content — The Marauder's Atlas

| Unit | Topic | Cards | Quiz questions |
|------|-------|-------|----------------|
| Unit 1 | World map and compass directions | 8 | 10 |
| Unit 2 | Africa — our continent | 9 | 14 |
| Unit 3 | Physical map of Africa | 10 | 17 |
| Unit 4 | Images of Africa | 7 | 9 |

Each unit contains content cards, a memory hook card, a tap-to-reveal glossary card, and a quiz unlocked at the end of the deck.

### Study cards
- Swipe left/right (touch) + prev/next buttons
- Card count always visible ("Card 3 of 7")
- Keywords highlighted with `<mark>` (gold tint on parchment)
- Memory hook cards — visually distinct dark amber, one per unit
- Glossary card at end of each unit — tap to reveal definitions
- Quiz button appears only after all cards are viewed and the unit is not yet done

### Card photography (Phase 6)

16 info cards carry a contextual photograph below the card text. Images are lazy-loaded, full card width, capped at 220px height, with a small italic credit line. 8 abstract or technique cards were intentionally left without images.

All images are sourced from Wikimedia Commons under CC or public domain licences. See `geoquest-images-manifest.md` for the full download list with source filenames, licence details, and direct URLs.

### Quiz
- Multiple choice, 4 options per question
- Questions shuffle on every attempt (Fisher-Yates on a copy of the array)
- Wrong answer: shake animation + correct answer highlighted green + banner
- Next question locked for 1.5s after a wrong answer
- Score summary shows every question with the correct answer listed
- XP on completion: +10 per correct, +20 bonus for perfect, +30 extra for first-attempt perfect
- One-and-done per session — completed units show best score, locked until Start Fresh

## XP and levelling

| Level | Title | XP required |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | Lost Traveller 🧭 | 0 |
| 1 | Scout 🗺️ | 50 |
| 2 | Ranger ⛺ | 120 |
| 3 | Pathfinder 🔭 | 220 |
| 4 | Cartographer 📍 | 360 |
| 5 | Master Geographer 🌍 | 540 |

XP, unit completion, best scores, and level are stored in `localStorage` under the key `gq_v1`.

### Level-up visuals
- **Level-up overlay** — if a quiz pushes her to a new level, tapping "Back to World" shows a full-screen overlay with the new level icon and title. Auto-dismisses after 2.5s then navigates onward.
- **Level pill pulse** — gold ring pulse on the level pill every time she returns home after completing a unit.
- **Grand Quest bar** — resets to 0 on each home render then animates to the real value, making progress visible as a sweep.

---

## Grand Quest complete — Mischief Managed

When all four Term 1 units are done, tapping "Back to World" after the final quiz triggers a full-screen parchment celebration:

- A dark curtain folds away (CSS scaleY animation) to reveal parchment
- 🗺️ seal, "Mischief Managed!" heading, Dumbledore-flavoured praise (with a Snape joke)
- Total XP earned
- "Seal the Map 🔴" button to dismiss
- If a level-up also occurred, the level-up overlay plays after dismissal

---

## Grand Quest progress

A progress bar at the top of every screen tracks completion across all units in all worlds. Term 1 has 4 units (25% each). Once all four worlds are built it will track across 16 units total.

---

## PWA / offline

Works fully offline after first load. Service worker uses cache-first strategy. To force a cache bust after deployment, increment `CACHE_NAME` in `sw.js`.

On iOS (Safari): tap Share → Add to Home Screen.

---

## Design rules (AuDHD — non-negotiable)

- No time limits anywhere
- No "you failed" screens — wrong answers show the correct answer with encouragement
- Card count always visible
- Progress always visible
- Transitions 150–200ms max
- One idea per card, four sentences maximum
- Dark shell (`#0f0d0b`), warm card surfaces (`#faf3e0` parchment for World 1)
- Swipe navigation on all card decks

---

## Tech notes

- Vanilla JS — `var` throughout, `innerHTML`, no modules
- No build step — edit `index.html` directly
- BASE path is `/geoquest/` — update in both `index.html` and `sw.js` if the repo name changes
- Nunito loaded from Google Fonts CDN — requires internet on first load only
